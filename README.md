#Solo-Objects
- I am doing this project to practice creating objects.
- I chose to model this team as an object because I don't know anything about sports, and
  my home team had 10 properties to work with

##Sample output
I am Julie and my home team is Team Mike. My husband is Bruce. We were married in 2004; the second for each of us.
Together we have 4 children. My son's name is Zeff, and my stepchildren are Kevin, Alex, and Julie.
